___ Design Thinking ___
	- "iterating in the technical domain"
	- Understand -> Define -> Ideas -> Prototype -> Test

___ Bitwise Operations ___
	- C bitwise AND: &
		- CH = CH & 0X3C
		- x AND 1 = x (keep)
		- x AND 0 = 0 (reset)

	__ Class Exercise __
		char ch;
		short n;
		
		Clear the upper half of ch:
			ch &= 0x0F
		Clear every other bit of ch starting from 0
			ch &= 0xAA
		Clear the lower half of n
			ch &= 0xFF00

	- C bitwise OR: |
	- C bitwise XOR: ^
		- x ^ 1 = toggles x
		- x ^ 0 = leaves x
	- C bitwise inversion: ~
	- C bitwise shift left: <<
		- similar to multiplying by two
	- C bitwise shift right: >>
		- similar to dividing by two


	- ~(1<<4)
		0000 0001
		0001 0000 -- <<4
		1110 1111 -- finished

	- package pins
	- pins with shared (multiplexed) functionality
		- GPIO
		- device I/O
	- memeory mapped registers
		- config registers
		- data registers
		- status registers
