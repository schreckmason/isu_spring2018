C String review and printing to standard input


Class Activity:
	Predict the value of message after each line:
		char str1[] = "hello";
		char str2[] = "world";
		char message[100];
		
		sprintf(message, "The meaning of life is %d",42);
		//message = "The meaning of life is 42"
		sprintf(message, "The meaning of life is %s.", str1);
		//message = "The meaning of life is hello"
		sprintf(message, "%S %s", str1, str2);
		//message = "hello world"
		sprintf(message, "%s %s", str1+1, str2+3);
		//message = "ello ld"


Lab Pro-Con list:
	Step 1:
		Identify at least 3-5 pros and 3-5 cons of printing messages to the LCD screen. 
			Pros: readable, no internet or other connectivity necessary, cost effective
			Cons: small print, limited time to read or parse scrolling text, must wait for scrolling banner if incomprehensible the first time.

	Step 2:
		Share your pros and cons with your neigbor. Identify the different users or groups of users you thought about when listing pros and cons.
			user group: older people / or people who's primary language is not english -- thus the derived difficulty of having a limited time to read scrolling text

	Step 3:
		Together with your neighbor discuss at least 3-5 ideas you have to provide a new way of communicating to that user that could resolve the issue described.
		These can involve modifications to the existing system or entirely new communication methods.
			- ensure large print, and a larger board to ensure that the message being portrayed can be displayed as a whole word at a time to reduce reading difficulty 
			- determine some statistically significant time frame based upon the average reading comprehension standard to determine how slowly the text needs to scroll
