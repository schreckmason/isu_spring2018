___ HTTP request message ___
	- two types of HTTPS messages:
		- request, response
	- HTTP request message:
		- ASCII (human-readable format)
		- e.g. (request header):
			GET /index.html HTTP/1.1\r\n
			Host: www-net.cs.umass.edu\r\n
			User-Agent: Firefox/3.6.10\r\n
			Accept: test/html, application/xhtml+xml\r\n
			Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5\r\n
			Accept-Encoding: aqip,deflate\r\n
			Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7\r\n
			Keep-Alive: timeout=120\r\n
			Connection: keep-alive\r\n
			\r\n
		Note: if you see "Keep-Alive" then it is a persistent connection

___ Method types ___
	- GET
		- requests an object
		
	- POST
		- uploads form input to server in entity body

	- HEAD
		- asks server to leave requested object out of response
		- useful for debugging (make sure that a connection is made / object exists on server)

	- PUT
		- uploads file in entity body to path specified in URL field

	- DELETE
		- deletes file specified in the URL field

___ HTTP response status codes ___
	- some sample status codes : 

		-200 OK:
			- request succeeded, requested object included in response msg
		-301 Moved Permanently:

			- requested object moved, new location specified later in this msg (Location:)
		-400 Bad Request:

			- request msg not understood by server
		-404 Not Found:

			- requested document not found on this server

		- 505 HTTP Version Not Supported:

___ Trying out HTTP (client side) for yourself ___
	1. Telnet to your favorite web server:
		e.g. - "telnet gaia.cs.umass.edu 80"

___ User-server state: cookies ___
	- HTTP is stateless: server maintains no information about past client requests
	- many websites use cookies to identify users
		-four components:
			1. cookie header line of HTTP response msg
			2. cookier header line in next HTTP request msg
			3. cookie file kept on user's host, managed by user's browser
			4. back-end database at website
___ Cookies (continued) ___
	-cookies can be used to/for/in:
		- authorization
		- shopping carts
		- recommendations
		- user session state (web e-mail)
		Note: cookies permit sites to learn a lot about you (e.g., name, email, etc..)


___ Web caches (proxy server) ___
	-goal: satisfy client request without involving origin server
	
	- user's browser can be configured to direct all HTTP reqeusts to web cache
	- browser sends an HTTP request to cache
		- object in chace: cache returns an object
		- else cache requests object from morigin server, then returns object to client
		Note: proxy server operates simultaneously as a client and a server

___ More about Web caching ___
	- typically cache is installed by access ISP (university, company, residential ISP)
	- why web cahcing?
		- reduce response time for client request
		- reduce traffic on an institutions's access link
		- reduce Internet traffic, improving performance for all applications


___ Conditional GET ___
	- copy of object in cache may be staly -> HTTP ahs a mechanism that allows a cache to verify that its object are up-to-date
	- cache:
		- specify date of cached copy in HTTP request
		- e.g. "If-modified-since: <date>"
	- server:
		- response contains no object if cached copy is up-to-date
