Note: still need to finish reviewing packet switching vs circuit switching

Note: homework 1 due 1/23 at 11:59 p.m.

___Internet structure: network of networks:___

	internet is packet switching

	hosts aka end systems connect to Internet via access ISPs:
		- residential, company, and university ISPs

	access ISPs in turn must be interconnected:
		- so that any two hosts can send packets to each other

	at center of the network there is a small # of well-connected large networks:
		- "tier-1" commercial ISPs (level 3, sprint, at&t...) national and internation coverage
		- content provider network (e.g., Google): private network that connects its data center to Internet, often bypassing tier-1 and regional ISP

__Definition__
	- IXP: internet exchange point

___How do loss and delay occur?___

	When packet arrival rate to link exceeds output link capacity, packets queue in router buffers, wait for turn

	if no buffers are free for arriving packets, arriving packets are dropped (loss)

	Four sources of packet delay:
		- transmission
		- propagation
		- queue
		- nodal processing

	delay total = processing + queue + transmission + propagation

	nodal processing:
		- check bit errors
		- determine output link
		- typically a few microseconds

	queueing delay:
		- time waiting at output queue for transmimssion
		- depends on congestion level of router
	
	transmission delay:
		- L: packet length (bits)
		- R: link bandwidth (bps)
		- transmission delay = L/R
		Note: time to push each bit onto a link
	
	prapagation delay:
		- d: length of physical link
		- s: propagation speed (~2x10^8 m/sec)
		- prop. delay = d/s
		Note: how long it takes a bit to go from one end of the physical link to the other end

___"Real" Internet delays and routes___
	what do "real internet delay & loss look like?

	traceroute:
		- provides delay measurement from source to router along end-end Internet path towards destination 
		Note: for all router i:
			- sends three packets that will reach router i on path towards destination
			- router i will return packets to sender
			- sender times interval between ransmission and reply

___Throughput___
	end-to-end throughput:
		- rate (bits/second) at which bits are transferred between sender and receiver
	
	throughput = F/T
		- F is file size, T is time taken to transfer file from server to client
