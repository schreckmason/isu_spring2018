Note: 7th edition of teh textbook necessary since homework will be assigned from it

Internet comprised of five layers:
	5. Application
	4. Transport
	3. Network
	2. Data Link
	1. Physical (not covered within this course)

Grade breakdown
	- 8 homework assignments (30%)
	- two programming assignments (15%)
	- midterm (25%)
	- final exam (30%)
	- final grades curved
	NOTE: NO LATE WORK ACCEPTED

Hosts:
	- PC
	- Server
	- wireless laptop
	- smartphon
	- hosts = end systems running network apps

Packet Switches:
	- router
	- link-layer switches
	- packet switches: forward packets (chunks of data)

Communicaiton links
	- wireless links
	- wired links
	- fiber; copper; radio
	- transmission rate: bandwidth

Internet:
	- internet is a  network of networks
	- interconnected internet service providers
	- hosts and packet switche srun protocols taht control the sending and receiving of information ( TCP, IP, HTTP, 802.11 )	
	- an infrastructure that provides services to applications ( Web, VoIP, email, games, e-commerce... )
	- provides programming interface to applications (sockets)
	- protocol: defines the rules of communication between two entities ( which messages, what order, and responses allowed )

__Definition__ 
	a protocol defines hthe format and the order of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entities, as well as the actions taken or transmission and receipt of message or other event


______ Chapter 1 ______

	network edge:
		- hosts: clients and servers
		- servers often in data centers
	access networks:
		- networks that physically connect and end system to the first router, aka edge router
	Q: How to connect end systems to edge router?
		A1: residential access nets: DSL, cable network
		A2: mobile wireless access networks: WiFi, 3G, 4G, LTE
		A3: institutional networks (university, company): Ethernet

___Wireless access networks ___
	- shared wireless access network connects end system to router via "access point"
	wireless LANs:
		- within building (100 ft.)
		- 802.11b/g/n (WiFi) 11,54,450 Mbps transmission rate

	wide-area wireless acess:
		- provided by telco (cellular) operator 10's km
		- between 1 and 10 Mbps
		- 3G, 4G, LTE

___Enterprise access networks___
	- typicall used in companies, universities, etc.
	- 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, 1Gbps, 10Gbps transmission rates
	- end system typically connected into Ethernet switch

___Physical media___
	guided media:
		- signals propagate in solid media: copper, fiber, coax (physical wire)

	unguided media:
		- signals propagate freely e.g., radio

___Physical media: twisted pair, coax, fiber___
	twisted pair (TP):
		- two insulated copper wires

	coaxial cable:
		- broadband: multiple channels on cable

	fiber optic cable:
		high-speed operation: 10-100's Gbps transmission rate
		
		low error rate: immune to electromagnetic noise
