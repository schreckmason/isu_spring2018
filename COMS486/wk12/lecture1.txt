___ Making routing scalable ___
	- our routing study thus far - idealized
		- all router identical
		- network "flat"
		NOTE: NOT TRUE IN PRACTICE

	- scale: with billions of destinations and hundreds of millions of routers:
		- overhead communicating, computing, and storing routing info becomes prohibitive

___ Internet approach to scalable routing ___
	- aggregate routers into regions known as "autonomous systems (ASes)" a.k.a "domains"

	__ intra-AS routing __
		- routing among routers in same AS
		- all routers in an AS must run same intra-domain routing protocol
		- different ASes can run different intra-domain routing protocols
	__ inter-AS routing __
		- routing among ASes
		- gateway router: at "edge" of an AS has link(s) to router(s) in other ASes
		- gateway routers perform inter-domain routing (as well as intra-domain routing)

___ Interconnected ASes ___
	- forwarding table configured by both intra and inter-AS routing algorithms
		- intra-AS routing determine entries for destinations within AS
		- inter-AS & inter-AS determine entries for external destinations

___ Intra-AS Routing Protocols ___
	- also known as interior gateway protocols (IGP)
	- most common intra-AS routing protocols
		- RIP: routing information protocol
		- OSPF: open shourtest path first
		-

___ OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) ___
	- "open" : publicly available (RFC2328)
	- uses link-state algorithm
		- link-state packet dissemination (link state packet just knows about links connected to a node and each respective link traversal cost)
		- topology map at each node
		- route computation using Dijkstra's algorithm
	- router floods OSPF link-state packets to all other routers in ENTIRE AS
		- link-state packet contains cost and status (up/down) for each attached link
		- carried in OSPF messages directly over IP
	- when does a router broadcast its link-state packet?
		- when there is a change in link's state
		- periodically (every 30 mins)

	__ "Advanced" features __
		- security: OSPF message can be authenticated 
		NOTE: don't want a 'bad' router to lie about information and thus generate an incorrect link-state packet
		- multiple same-cost paths allowed (this allows for a load to be split upon multiple same cost links to the same interface)
		- integrated uni and multi-cast support:
			- multicast OSPF (MOSPF) uses same topology database as OSPF
			- e.g. multi-cast allows for a message to be sent to multiple destinations from one source (like a video broadcast)
		- hierarchical OSPF in large ASes
			- splits AS into backbone and non-backbone areas, OSPF only ran in each non backbone area independent of one another to avoid scalability issue

___ Inter-AS routing ___
	- suppose router in AS1 receives datagram destined outside of AS1:
		-router should forward packet to gateway router, but which one?
	- AS1 MUST:
		1. learn which destinations are reachable
		2. forward this reachable information to all gateway routers in AS1

___ Internet inter-AS routing: BGP ___
	- BGP (border gateway protocol): the de facto inter-domain routing protocol
	- BGP provides each AS a means to:
		- obtain subnet reachability information from nighboring ASes using eBGP(external BGP)
		- propagate reachability information to all AS internal routers using iBGP (internal BGP)
		- determine "good" routes to other networks based on reachability information and policy
		NOTE: gateway routers run both eBGP and iBGP whereas internal routers run only iBGP protocols

___ BGP basics ___
	- BGP sessions: two BGP routers ("peers") exchange BGP messages over TCP connection
		-advertising paths to different destination network prefixes (BGP is a "path vector" protocol

___ Path attributes and BGP routes ___
	- advertised prefix includes BGP attributes
		- prefix + attributes = "route"
	- two important attributes:
		- AS-PATH: list of ASes through which prefix advertisement has passed
		- NEXT-HOP: indicates IP address of the router interface that begins the AS path
	- Policy-based routing:
		- gateway router receiving route advertisement uses import policy to accept/decline path
		- AS policy also determines whether to advertise to advertise path to other neighboring ASes
